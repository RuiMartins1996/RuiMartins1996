## About me

My name is Rui and I'm a PhD student in Mathematics at the University of Aveiro, Portugal. 
The main objective of my thesis is to improve the software techniques used in Electrical Impedance Tomography, namely by leveraging automatic differentiation to possibly accelerate some of the tasks. 

Currently I am working on applications of automatic differentiation in:

- Ordinary Differential Equations solvers, namely explicit Runge-Kutta methods
- The Conjugate Gradient Method.
