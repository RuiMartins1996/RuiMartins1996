## About me

My name is Rui and I'm a PhD student in Mathematics at the University of Aveiro, Portugal. 
The main objective of my thesis is to improve the software techniques used in Electrical Impedance Tomography, namely by leveraging automatic differentiation to possibly accelerate some parts of the code.
